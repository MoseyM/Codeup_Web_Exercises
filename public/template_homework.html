// Your homework, should you choose to accept it, is to build the highlow game inside Javascript!
 
// Use a prompt to ask the user a yes or no question: "Would you like to play a game?"
 
// If they choose yes, start the game!
 
// You're going to need a loop, and you're going to have to accept user input for each guess.
// You're also going to have to tell the user if they need to guess higher, or lower.
 
// This will get you started:
 
// Creates a random number between 1 and 100.
