		<!-- Hello from Codeup! -->
		<h1> The Beginning </h1>
		<p> I use to <strong> hate </strong> the way ways are. The tremendous doubt that falls upon you as if you are a leaf under a boulder. People, saying it as a plural, with weak tripulations and secure manipulations strike the world with the same hate that has bestowed my vocabulary. It is not <em> interesting </em>em> moreso it is <em> dissatifying</em>. <br> Growth and learning are worthy of time. All other aspects we devote our yearn for are not. </p>

		<h2>My Vehicle</h2>
		<p>I've had my car for a little over 2 years. We have driven to North Carolina together. Went to the casinos together and have done all kinds of other great things, including, unfortunately colloecting quite a bit of traffic tickets and scratched a few things. Nonetheless, it has held up strong and is still running even with more than 100,000 miles we have quite a few miles to go. Love the car I drive. </p>
