		<h1> The Beginning </h1>
		<p> I use to <strong> hate </strong> the way ways are. The tremendous doubt that falls upon you as if you are a leaf under a boulder. People, saying it as a plural, with weak tripulations and secure manipulations strike the world with the same hate that has bestowed my vocabulary. It is not <em> interesting </em>em> moreso it is <em> dissatifying</em>. <br> Growth and learning are worthy of time. All other aspects we devote our yearn for are not. </p>
